I really do not have any hate towards programming
at this moment in time.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, I am doing my best to get myself into an Email Development

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I did NOT have any direction in life when I was younger, but I would say, "stop fucking around and learn code!"
