### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name's Kevin Barreto and I am from Mexico. I am 27 years young.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I don't remember the exact moment but what I do remember is that I stumbled upon a youtube video about HTML and it got me curious to start digging deeper into the rabbit hole. From there on it was just losing myself into the programming world without knowing where to go.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn fully last year in the month of August. I was trying to learn the basics of HTML and CSS but since it was something new for me, I gave up easy and worked on it from time to time.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I bought courses from Udemy and watched Youtube videos. Whatever I see useful information I try to learn it. But for the moment the only platform I like is CodingPhase even though there's hundreds of platforms, this one has the best projects and instructor most def.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the challenge of learning new things.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate everything lol. Nahh but for real it's the logic to make a program work. Finding bugs and all that hard stuff.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No I am not. Although I have done work for a client but he didn't pay so I had to take it down. My goal is to freelance since it's difficult for me to move to another city.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Favorite stack is either MERN or LAMP

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I wish to learn PHP and React. But before all that, I want to become fluent in JS.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself creating niches websites where they generate income for me and being a great freelancer building websites for businesses

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Stick to the tutorials and finish them even if they are 50+ hours. Stick to the basics and practice practice practice the learned concepts.
