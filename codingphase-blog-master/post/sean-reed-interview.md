### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Sean

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've always been interested in computers and how they work.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn to code about a year and three months ago.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I started learing to code on Free Code Camp then on Coding Phase now I try to find new info where ever I can learn something new that I can use.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love when you finally get the result that you are aiming for it feels like you have unlocked an achievement in a video game.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate getting stuck in a rabbit hole of information on stack over flow.  When you are looking for an answer to something and you look up and have went on a hour long tangent and still haven't found the answer to the question that you were looking for.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am currently working on my portfolio getting together the projects to find work as a developer.  

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I have done about 85% of the projects on Coding Phase and until now I have like just about everything that I have done currently I have been using foundation that has been pretty cool.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

In the future want to master Javascript and Python.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years I want to be making money off of my passive income projects and if I haven't moved on to my own bussiness I would like to be working at a senior dev level.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

If I could go back in time I would tell myself to find Coding Phase way sooner. I worked through FCC until the projects section then I started over from the beginning when I got to Coding Phase.  I would also tell myself don't doubt the process just keep working and you will get the answer eventually.  Finding Coding Phase was like finding a mentor that you might get through a bootcamp and it has really helped to simplify the process of learning to code.
