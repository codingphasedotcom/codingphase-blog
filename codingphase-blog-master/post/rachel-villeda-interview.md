### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name is Rachel, I'm from Los Angeles, I'm 47 and I'm tired of working at bullshit jobs.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I wanted to know how content got put up on the internet and asked google a question.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started in 2011, off and on.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I started on freecodecamp and then heard about bootcamps. I researched bootcamps and found my way to your videos and now I learn from codingphase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I don't know yet, at this point I haven't got into too much of it to have a good answer.

### What do you hate about programming?

What I don't like about programming is trying to set up environments. I am always getting lost.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, I am still stuck at my crappy job because I haven't put in the work in programming to level up. Too much situtations keep comming up in my life and I feel like something just won't allow me to learn and be cofident enough to start looking for a developer job.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't yet, still unfamilar with most of programming.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn php after I am used to html/css and javascript.

For the first time in my life I can actually answer that. I see myself working as a developer and making passive income.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would say to get my ass to work and start putting in the time and quit wasting time.
