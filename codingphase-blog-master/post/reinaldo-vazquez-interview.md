Hello, My name is Reinaldo Vazquez. I live in Florida. I am 30 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've been interested in programming for a long time since I was a teenager. However I would often time get bored on some of the courses or simply not understand. Also
at that time I was interested in many other things as well. So the motivation wasn't there. Now I currently want to become a developer and love everything about it so far.

I started to learn code when I was 15 years old but then stop and jumped back into it now at 30 years old.

where to learn skills depends on what you're are trying to learn but to relate to programming i'd say youtube.com and codingphase.com is great for learning new skills and getting resources.

Creating something out of nothing is probably most people's response and I agree.

It's hard to say whats my favorite stack since I haven't learn much about them yet. 

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

there is many but I would have to say the necessary skills needed to become a full stacker developer.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself in 5 years as a full stack developer with a nice side hustle (passive income).

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

If I can go back in time and give my self advice I would say learn all the front end stuff first become great at it also get a job and then start learning back end.
