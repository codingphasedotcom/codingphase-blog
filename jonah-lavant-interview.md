### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

What's good Joe! My name is Jonah Lavant. I'm from Albany, GA currently residing in Atlanta, GA. I'm 40 years old and I just picked up an interest in coding about a few months ago.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I have a Masters and Bachelors degree in Health Informatics. The courses touched a little on code, but not much more than basic HTML and CSS. I really wasn't interested in programming until I realized that programmers get to the bag.

### When did you start learning to code?

February 15, 2021

### Where do you learn new skills?

codingphase.com and youtube

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the opportunites that programming provides. Programming opens the door for entreprenuership, to create helpful applications, and the chance to chase the bag.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate not being comfortable and confident in my skills as a programmer.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I wish.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite stack is wherever the bag is. I'm too new to really know, but I want to be wherever provides the most opportunity.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

React, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and anything that would help me get to the bag through ecommerce or developing apps in the healthcare field.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself running a successful digital agency and securing the bag.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I definitely wouldn't have gotten a Masters degree in Health Informatics. If I'm going to go into debt getting a degree, I would have majored in Computer Science, or just avoid the student loan debt completely and join codingphase. Real Rap!
