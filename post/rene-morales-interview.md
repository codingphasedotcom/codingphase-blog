I was a tech geek since childhood. I was one of those kids that used to break anything just to find a way on how to fixed it.

At the of age of 14 years old, I was introduce to coding by accident. I started to write HTML and at that moment I didn't know what HTML represent. When I started college and the major that I was interested was computer engineer. After, I took several programming courses such as Computer Science and Web Programming that when I realize what HTML represent, and my passion for programming.
