### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Daisy Pineda and I'm from California and I'm 25 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I first got interested in programming since my boyfriend started learning web development and he told me I should look into it too. After I did, I fell in love with it since then.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn since 2016 but I was in the middle of a certificate program for another career field so I didn't fully immerse myself into it like I wish I would have.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I first realized I really loved coding on codecademy.com and then I moved on to Teamtreehouse after that. I also went through the "HTML and CSS" and "JavaScript and jQuery" books by Jon Duckett. I had an understanding of all the basics but it wasn't until signing up for codingphase.com that I was actually able to put all my knowledge together and it clicked after that.

### What do you love the most about programming?

What I love the most about programming is that I can start from absolutely nothing and after I'm done with a project I get a amazing feeling of accomplishment.

### What do you hate about programming?

What can be frustrating about programming is when I'm looking for an answer to a bug and I can't find the answer. However, the feeling after finding the answer to the problem makes up for the feeling of frustration.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am not currently working as a developer but I am working on project to add to my portfolio.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

N/A

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would love to learn React in the future I still fairly new so it might take me a good while but I have heard pretty cool things about it.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I would love to be at a good company at a senior position doing what I love as part of a team working towards a common goal.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would tell myself that if I just set up a schedule to study and not make any excuses I could have learned a lot faster. Also to make projects as I learn or to follow along with coding projects since it really does make a difference in retaining the information.
