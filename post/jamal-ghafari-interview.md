### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Jamal, i'm 31, and located in Washington state. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

I built my first website back in highschool for a tech intro class, and edited my Myspace page alot until that site lost popularity. In 2018 I saw some ads on learning python and web development and after looking in to both, I regained my interest in web development again and have been self learning online after work and on the weekends.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started in highschool in a tech intro class.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Codingphase.com of course!

### What do you love the most about programming?

I really enjoy building new projects, continuous learning, and seeing a web page come together piece by piece with every new line of code I enter and save in VS code

### What do you hate about programming?

It can be frustrating sometimes when you can't find what code broke your page that was working a couple minutes ago, but that makes it so much more rewarding when you solve the issue with the code. 

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I'm not currently working as a developer, but becoming a front end developer is my goal, and is why I am studying on codingphase.com

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I'm still learing so I don't have a favorite stack yet, but I use windows and VS code.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would like to learn front-end web development which include html, css, and javascript. I would like to get good at the fundimentals, then learn new languages as I improve my programming skills.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years I see myself working as a front-end web developer for at least 3 years.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would tell myself to continue studying web development after the intro to tech class I took in highschool and don't give up or get frustrated. As long as you keep pushing through it will all start to click and make sense, no matter how hard it might seem in the moment.
