### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my name is Keng Vang. 27, from Minnesota.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've always been fascinated by the process of building websites from scratch. It all started when I played around with MySpace templates as a kid, and little did I know, that was web development. As I got older my interest and hobbies expanded to game design, and I even took some college courses on the subject. During that time, we discussed technologies like enchant.js, an old javascript framework no longer being used.

Unfortunately, unexpected circumstances led me to pause my programming journey and stop learning altogether. However, recently, I found myself picking it up again due to my lack of income. It was then I realized that I had to start from scratch and relearn everything. It's been an exciting journey of rediscovery and getting back into the world of programming and web development. But so much has changed since.

### When did you start learning to code?

My coding journey started a long time ago, but i took a long break and just recently got back into it. Relearning everything.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I usually pick-up new skills from YouTube, Google, or CodingPhase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The thing i love most about programming is being able to solve issues on my own.

### What do you hate about programming?

The thing i hate most about programming is getting stuck on a single problem for hours only to find out the issue was a typo.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No. I sure hope i do soon.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Since i'm still sort of fresh, i'd say javascript.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would like to learn TypeScript, PHP, SQL, and AWS.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself with a remote job working as web developer with a side business in development. Hope to be balling one day.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Just do it! FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED!
