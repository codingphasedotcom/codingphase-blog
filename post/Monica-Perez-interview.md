### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Monica and I'm from Utah. If you never heard of my state that's okay, all we are known for is snow and salt production. In recent years we have attracted a lot of tech companies and have been coined the term Silicon Slopes.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I saw an ad for the hour of code on TV and thought it looked like a fun skill to learn. I created an account via code.org and codecademy.com. Through these sites, I learned all about HTML and  CSS and created my first website. I did this back in 2012, and coding tutorials weren't as polished as they are today. I also remember borrowing books from the library on Python and C++. I'm a visual learner so, these thick textbooks didn't help me understand what I was doing. Due to this, I took a long break from coding.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning for fun in 2012, but 2019 is when I officially started to take my coding studies seriously.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I like to use a multitude of resources when learning different things. Right now, I'm taking courses from codingphase.com, YouTube tutorials, and I have also completed some Udemy courses in the past.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love that feeling I get when I solve a bug in my code.

### What do you hate about programming?

CSS is very powerful and is often overlooked as an easy tech skill that one can learn in a day, but this is not true if you want to dive deeper into front end web development roles. I have a love-hate relationship with certain aspects of CSS, but I'm learning to take it one step at a time.

### Are you currently working as a developer?
Not yet, but once I get enough experience and complete enough projects, I will start applying for junior front end positions.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Not sure yet.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would like to learn more about APIS and how to use them. I'm interested in learning PHP and JavaScript. I also wish to learn node.js in the future.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I want to gain enough work experience to start my own business.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would tell myself to create a fixed schedule to study coding every day. I use to only do one to two hours of studying.  But to reach my goals, I'm trying to push for three to four hours on weekdays. I would also tell myself that math shouldn't hold you back from learning to code. No one tells you that basic math, most of the time, is all you need for web development. If you want to dive deep into machine learning and or artificial intelligence then you will need a good grasp on college math concepts, but you don't need that for web development. Okay, maybe you will need to practice algorithm and data structures for back end development, but there are a ton of resources out there.
