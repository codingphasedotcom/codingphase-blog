### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name is Ebrahem Luhar, I live in Sheffield, England and I am 23 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I first found out about programming in late 2016 and tried occasionally building website templates with HTML and CSS, using W3Schools as my primary resource. But in mid 2018 I started taking my learning of web development a lot more seriously and have been constantly learning new technologies since.

### When did you start learning to code?

Late 2016 using W3Schools. I later used freeCodeCamp and Youtube before finding CodingPhase.

### Where do you learn new skills?

CodingPhase is where I mainly go to learn about web development as the tutorials there are presented clearly and every project has some real world application when it comes to working as a developer.

### What do you love the most about programming?

When it comes to programming I really enjoy putting things together a little bit at a time. Even though there will be problems along the way, making something cool that actually works is very satisfying. 

### What do you hate about programming?

Getting stuck with an error or bug which takes a lot longer to fix than I thought it would.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, not yet.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I have not used any specific stack, but i like to build static web apps and want to build more e-commerce and dynamic web applications.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would like to be a full stack developer so PHP, MySQL and a Javascript framework like React would be what I am aiming to learn next.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself as a mid/senior developer at a good company where I enjoy working.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Take coding more seriously when I first found out about it. Also, to build more applications using any new programming language this I was learning.
