### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is David and I'm a soldier. I'm 33 yrs old and live in the Pacific Northwest with my wife and kids. As a soldier who is getting ready to transition back into the civilian world, I am so grateful I found CodingPhase.com and it's community.

### How did you get interested in programming?

Back in the day Myspace was the social media platform of choice. I got interested when I found out I could change the HTML to customize my page.

### When did you start learning to code?

Myspace was more of a copy and paste thing, but what really got me into coding was the TI-86 calculator. I know, I'm a nerd lol. I copied the code written in "C" to have Super Mario on my calculator. Soon after I found out all the complex equations for my math class could be programmed into my calculator.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Not sure if I'm answering this right but the internet. Specifically, I spend a lot of my driving time letting YouTube go from one video to the next and I just listen. Then when I'm at home I have some topics to research more in depth.

### What do you love the most about programming?

With programming I can build anything I can imagine, and some of the stuff can leave the digital world and enter the physical world. At heart I am a builder more than a programmer. I love learning anything new and with programming that is an every day occurance.

### What do you hate about programming?

This is a tricky question because the thing I hate leads to the thing I love. I hate when I get stuck, whether its a bug in the code, or the command line commands aren't working. But once I figure it out, I fall back in love with programming.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Currently I am not working as a developer, but I hope to be soon. Tryin to get those bags.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite stack would have to the LAMP stack. Thanks to your courses Joe I have become a Google and StackOverflow junkie. Because of that I have been able to fully convert my laptop to a Linux distro. By the end of the summer I want to be contributing to open source projects using LAMP.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Soon I will be tackling the PHP 7 and Laravel course on codingphase.com and I'm really excited about that. After seeing all the new stuff I could do with it I am pumped.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years see myself traveling regularly and working 100% remote. Working for someone else only makes sense to learn what I need to learn. Then I'll follow in your footsteps Joe.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would say to go straight to codingphase.com lol. But really, I kept trying to find somewhere that had relevant projects. Heck, any projects that weren't imaginary, something that resembled a real world example. I would tell younger me to not bounce around from site to site trying to follow the next fad in programming. The final gem I would give myself is to just keep going even when new info doesn't make sense because eventually it all just clicks, that "Aha" moment.
