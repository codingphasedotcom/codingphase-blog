### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello my name is Gabriel, and I am 26 years old. I live in Phoenix Arizona, and have lived here my entire life.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I got my first taste in Highschool when I took a webpage building class and our final project was to build a site with multiple pages and functioning buttons on our favorite show. Its always been at the back of my mind. It was sparked again when I was let go from a previous job I held down for years. While looking for new jobs at the time, I stumbled across some youtube channels. The first channel was Chris Sean, and through Chris I found Joe.

### When did you start learning to code?

Off and On due to my own Excuses of "Well my current job isnt too bad...even though I will never make enough to support my family". That puts me around beginning of 2019.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Solely on Codingphase.com, I have a few courses on Udemy, but since finding Joe I haven't looked back.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The almost limitless possibilities of what you can create. Just basic HTML/CSS can make beautiful pages.

### What do you hate about programming?

Getting stuck

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

To be honest I do not have one yet. If Progressive Web Apps count then I would say PWA's.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Python and Svelt

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Having parted ways with the typical 9-5 in office jobs and Freelance/work remote. 

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Just stick to it, it gets easier as you continue. One day it will just click and you'll think back how far you come. Also to stop doing the "Well ill take a few day break" as it turns into a week and then a month. Only to make you regret taking a break as you could've learned so much in that "break".
