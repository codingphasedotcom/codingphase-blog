>> Well age aint nothing but a number.

### How did you get interested in programming?

#### I have always been interested in technology building and maintaining PC's.

### When did you start learning to code?

#### I was asked to build a website for a variety band to help them get some exposure. I researched google and decided to use a CMS called Joomla and then later switching to Wordpress. This went well so I decided to get a degree from The University of Phoenix where I recieved an Associates degree in Web Technology.

### What do you hate about programming?

#### The thing I hate the most about programing would be the light mode themes that come with most text editors.
>
>> #### Because they often times attract the most bugs. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### Are you currently working as a developer?

#### I am currently a freelance **Software Engineer**.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

#### I do not have a stack currently as my emphasis is not directed to working for a company.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

#### I would like to learn PHP as well cement a good foundation of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

#### I have re-dedicated myself to continual learning and finding ways to convert that knowledge into finacial enrichment. That is my goal for now and for my future.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

#### If I were to go back in time to give myself advice, I would tell me to surround myself with people who encouraged my interest and those that helped to correlate them with real world relateable careers.

 #### I would advise no matter how hard it may be to do you must let go of people who rigidly tell you 
 
 - "It's not that easy", 
 
 - "That is not possible", 
 >> or 
 
 - "You need to be more realistic" 
 
 #### as these beliefs were antithetical to my developmet and or success.
