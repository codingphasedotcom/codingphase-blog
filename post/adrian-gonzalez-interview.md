### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello my name is Adrian Gonzalez and currently live in Waco, Tx.   I am 40 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

Well I picked up a python book over the summer 2019 at local library.  Did little here and there.  Was exploring new career.  Was looking into getting into Information Technology career like getting Comptia certs and so on.  But when I looked into coding I really spark my interest.  So here I am learning how to code

### When did you start learning to code?

I actually start last October 2019 but due to the holidays and working two jobs at that time I had to put my studying of web development down for a bit but now I am able to give more time into web development.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Besides Coding Phase website I also look at Youtube and Udemy.  

### What do you love the most about programming?

Well my previous jobs was mainly labor intensive and seeing that being a programer you can just set at a desk or just standup in one place to do work is awesome and get great pay too.  Plus the option to do remote work and do some travling at the same time.

### What do you hate about programming?

I wouldn't say I hate it but I think the beginning part when your learning they are some many resources online that you can get confused easily on what too use.  Its happen to me before you find one way of doing it and then you see another way of doing it I had me thinking which one is correct way and then I come to there realization that they more than one way to do a task in programming.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No I am not.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Not sure yet.  Still working to figure that out.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Python and Javascript

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Full Stack Developer who works from home and able to travel anywhere and still do my job with just a internet connection. Own my own house and driving a brand new Mercedez E Class Polar White color.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

From the little time I have been doing this I would say narrow you search down.  Just focus on one thing at a time and jump around from one thing to another if you haven't got an understanding what you just learn.  Otherwise you be more confused.
