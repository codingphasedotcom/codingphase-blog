### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hey, my name is Devlin.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I got into programming by coming across a few Youtuber that are programmers explaining how they were able to live in comfort becasue of working in programming. I started doing more research to understand exactly what programming was and found out a majority of programmers are self-taught.  I liked this because I was dreading the fact that I would have to go back to school to become a programmer or join some type of bootcamp.
### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn how to code about a month ago on freecodecamp.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I learn new skills anywhere I can, but for right now mainly on codingphase.com and some youtube videos.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the fact that it is great skill, especially in this day and age. It is not that hard to learn, but it takes time and repetition to be great at.  It is also a easy way to become a entrepreneur because you can use creativity and problem-solving to make a great living.  

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate when you are breezing through your code and all of a sudden I may get stuck on a problem in my code and it may take hours to figure out, especially when it is osmething that is very simple.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Nope. Not yet

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't have a favorite stack or application yet.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn Javascript, Php, and some Shopify themes and apps.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I will be enarning top dollar working for a company, but will be emerging as an successful entrepreneur operating my own business using the coding skills I've learned and beginning to leave corporate jobs for good.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would go back a month ago and tell myself to pay that $20 to codingphase.com and start to learning how to get established to get these checks.
