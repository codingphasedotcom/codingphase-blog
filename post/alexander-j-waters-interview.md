### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello world, my name is Alex, and i'm in my 30's living in New York City. I am originally from Clearwater Florida, and i've been comming to and from NYC for the last ten years for work and school.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I was introduced to JAVA by a friend. He taught me how to do some simple applications, and my mind just 
took off from there. 

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning to code about three years ago or so. 

### Where do you learn new skills?

I have learned most skills such as algorithms, JAVA, C++, and Databases in college. But never got any real
world experience until "CodingPhase.com."

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the way an idea can impact the world through software. How my brains awesomeness can build something that another human can benifit from.

### What do you hate about programming?

I get annoyed over the fact that things change so fast. It seems every couple of weeks some type of 
language is updating or getting more enhanced.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, only studying at the moment, but I have a lot of ideas for things that I feel the internet needs.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't have a favorite yet, but i'm thinking React will probably get me. After taking C++; I really 
liked the control the language provided and the libraries others have spent years creating to make my
life easier.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I really want to be a pro at vanilla javascript and know it from the inside-out. It just seems like there is more avenues to get employed and that all the good stacks stem from it.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I want to be running a few websites online and be living in a rural area to save money. The sky is the limit
I feel when it comes to coding, but I also know "it's not how much you make, but how much you save and invest."

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

When you get stuck on something for more than an hour, "look it up!" I have spent days upon days on just
one problem. This is a strong community of developers and getting help is part of the process in my opinion.
