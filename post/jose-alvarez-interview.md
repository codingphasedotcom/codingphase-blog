### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello. My name is Jose and I currently reside in Warwick, RI (originally raised in New York City).

### How did you get interested in programming?

This really began in the days of MySpace when everyone basically had to "design" their own profiles.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn real code and what every thing was/did at 26 long after the MySpace days.

### Where do you learn new skills?

My real world introduction to code was through the University of Phoenix online program. That degree program was geared toward software engineering (Java, VB.NET, C, C++) with minimal web dev (front end) knowledge.  It was only after completing my program that I realized I didnt know the basics and front end dev became more interesting to me. That led me to sites like freecodecamp, codeacademy, etc. Eventually I found codingphase on youtube and that led me to Udemy. Since then its solely a combination of codingphase.com and Udemy courses.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I think I enjoyed the creation process. Seeing the blueprint of sites and applications that no one ever sees.

### What do you hate about programming?

Making sense of syntax sometimes. That can be my most difficult obstacle when getting into a new language.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No but the deadline has been set. 1st quarter 2020.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I know HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS, BOOTSTRAP, JQUERY (mostly), JAVASCRIPT (including ES6), and currently learning REACTJS.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn SQL because of its use in so many organizations. Along with further improving what I know in VB.NET, JAVA and C++ which is what I learned in the University of Phoenix program.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I WILL be a developer. I dont want to say frontend or back simply because I plan on continuing to improve my skills and follow the road where it takes ne.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Pick 1 language and stick to it all the way before moving on to another. Tutorial hell will waste A LOT of your time and youll find that you have learned close to nothing trying to do it all at once. Treat each language like a stair case, take it 1 at a time. Dont worry about what everyone else is doing around you and whats "hot" because when you dont learn any of it for trying to much, "mans not hot".
