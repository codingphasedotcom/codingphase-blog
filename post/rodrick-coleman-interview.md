### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Rodrick and I am 41. I live in Durham, North Carolina.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I played around with game development using Game Maker. I became interested in web development by reading about the Urban Dictionary. I was surprised by how much traffic and revenue it earns.

### When did you start learning to code?

Too long ago... maybe part-time for the last four years.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I started at Team Tree House. I switched to Udemy. My current resource is Coding Phase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the problem solving of programming and the wide array  of opportunities it can provide.

### What do you hate about programming?

Getting stuck and not able to find the bug.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No. I am not working as a dev. 

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I do not have a favorite stack.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Javascript has been a huge pain to make sense of. React and the backend.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Working as a developer. On the side I would like produce educational content and services for grade school kids.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

You must code everyday for three to five hours. Do not jump around from language to language. You have to build a complete project and do not worry about how crappy it may looks, just finish it. Go to meetups to be around other developers.
