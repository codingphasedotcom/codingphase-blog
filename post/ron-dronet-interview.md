### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Ron. I'm a 52 year old Creative Director in Houston, Texas.   

### How did you get interested in programming?

Throughout my career I've dabbled in HTML and CSS and have designed and created maybe 8 websites. A little over a year ago I felt that programming would open up a whole new avenue and extension for me as a graphic artist so I began my journey after work and on weekends.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started really diving into programming late 2018 when I was 50 years old.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I've taken courses using Udemy, YouTube and currently CodingPhase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I used Dreamweaver for many years and I guess what I love about programming my own websites is that i have freedom and a better understanding of how things work under the hood. I didn't realize that learning programming languages will eventually help me on the path of freedom. Now that I see that path alot clearer I am very determined to learn as much as I can to succeed.

### What do you hate about programming?

When I started to learn programming I started out with JavaScript. I realized that this wasn't a quick learn. It takes time and practice to learn the fundamentals. I feel that I'm finally understanding and seeing the "MATRIX" behind it but I still have a very long way to go.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

As I mentioned above, I'm currently working as a creative director and my job does not involve programming.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I would have to say my favorite stack would be the web stack: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into front-end development and definitely looking forward to learning back-end development. As a creative director I use most of the Adobe Creative Suite software (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, After Effects and PremirePro) and I also use Sketch, Blender3D and Affinity Designer.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I'd love to find myself using my front-end development skills and adding React, NodeJS and any solid back-end programming language that work well together.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself being able to produce everything from branding to illustrations to websites to apps to databases. I want to be a one-man show focusing on my own clients. I'm already highly skilled as a graphic artist and illustrator with many years of experience. Programming to me will be the icing on the cake.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would have found a mentor to program with. I took a two week live course online with potential students studying to get into the App Academy and I found pair programming to be beneficial. It showed me how much I knew and how much I didn't know. Surprising enough I felt it boosted my confidence. My goal is to pass the assessment to get into the 3 month immersive cohart for the App Academy in San Francisco. Because of the current Covid 19 situation my plans to attend the bootcamp have been stalled.
