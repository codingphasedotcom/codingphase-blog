### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, My name is Michael, I am 33 years old.  I currently reside in Portland, OR.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've been interested in programming ever since I saw the movie "Hackers".

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning c++ in 2014 while taking Computer Science courses.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I was learning as much as possible with freeCodeCamp and codeCademy.  Since finding
codingPhase, I am strictly spending my time on codingphase.com.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the mental challenges that programming presents. There is always a problem
to solve or overcome.  As well, the answers to these problems aren't derived in the same manner, nor do they have to be.  Programming definitely helps to keep the mind sharp.  

### What do you hate about programming?

I'm still new to the field, so I'm sure that I haven't ran into any serious problems yet; but, the most frustrating thing I've encountered is running code and nothing happens, it doesn't work, there are no errors, just nothing.  It could be my error, the text editor, my computer, who knows???

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, I hope to be within a few months with the help of codingphase.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I couldn't say yet, I will definitely be finding out soon.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would love to learn mobile applications, but I am going to start with something that will land me a job as soon as possible, so I will be focusing on web devolopment with either JS(React) or PHP.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years, I would love to be doing freelancing work.  But, if I can establish myself in the industry, I would be happy working for a company as well.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would tell myself to work everyday, several hours a day.  Immerse yourself into it.
