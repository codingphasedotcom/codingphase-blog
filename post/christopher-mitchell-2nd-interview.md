### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Christopher Mitchell II. I am currently living in  Trenton, SC and I'm 50yrs old. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

I remember my first computer (Commodor Vic 20). Look it up, youngster. And really the only thing you could do on it was code. BASIC (not Visual BASIC) was what it was set up for. I was 12. (1980)

I thought is was the most amazing thing (at the time). And it was (at the time).

My Aunt's boyfriend bought it for me because I was a little depressed about my parent's divorce. Sorry for the TMI.

### When did you start learning to code?

I guess it was high school. Back in the day, most high schools had an 'Intro to Computers' class. Really it was a class to learn BASIC. I was already ahead of the curve because I was self-taught for about 2yrs prior. 

### Where do you learn new skills?

First it was FCC but now its CodingPhase. 

### What do you love the most about programming?

Problem Solving and the idea of projects with a beginning, middle, and an end. The cycle of going hard and grinding on a project, chill and relax after grinding, then gearing up for another grind has always appealed to me. 

I switched jobs alot because of this. I would grind into the learning curve of a new job. Then after learning it, I would realize that after learning the new skills that the job was actually boring and tedious. Then I would quit or just not show up (ghetto quitting). LOL!!

### What do you hate about programming?

Not much. If I had to say, it would be debugging. Not the process really; but, finding that really tough cockroach in your code and having to take a 15min break from pounding on it for a few hours. 

I hate the frustration; but, Love the feeling I get when I finally figure it out.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No not yet. Coming Soon!!

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

So far its SASS. It reminds me of BASIC. Just a little. Brings back some good memories. Damn, I'm such an old man. LOL

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

PHP and general front-end.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Living the Laptop Lifestyle. Passive income from a few Niche websites, an E-commerce site, and a few freelance clients (part-time).

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't let life's nonsense distract you. Stick with learning BASIC. Stick with Computer Science as your major and keep Business as your minor in college. 

Back then (late 80's) the CS major focused on coding (Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, C and C++, and even Assembly). This was before the tech bubble started. Wow, I think it might have been before the Internet was mainstream.
