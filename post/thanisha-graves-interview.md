### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my name is Thanisha and I'm from Portsmouth, VA but I now living in Orange County, CA.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've always been interested in computers since I was little but it wasn't until I was working in I.T., when I was in the army, that I discovered programming and web development. I consider myself to be introverted, so programming seemed to be a good fit for me.

### When did you start learning to code?

2016

### Where do you learn new skills?

Online

### What do you love the most about programming?

The fact that you can come up with an idea for a website/app and build it yourself within minutes and be able to present it. I don't know many industries that you can do that in.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate the elitism that some programmers have, especially when you're interviewing for a job or when you're asking a "newbie" question.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, but that is the goal.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't know yet, I haven't done enough to make a decision.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Mobile Development

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Hopefully I've quit my current job and I'm now using the skills I've learned working as a developer or freelancer.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't give up and quit just because you feel like that you're not smart enough for programming.
