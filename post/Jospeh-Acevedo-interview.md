### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Joseph, I'm originally from Queens NY, but I live in Texas. I am 24 years old and I am a developer.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I first became interested in programming when I was in high school. I had to figure out what I wanted to do with my life but didn't know what path to take,
All I knew was that I liked computers. Eventually I found Khan Academy's computer science course and I fell in love.

### When did you start learning to code?

My junior year of high school I discovered Khan Academy's computer science course. They would have you draw shapes like circles and squares in either python or javascript,
and from there I started buying courses on Udemy.

### Where do you learn new skills?

It depends on the situation. If I need to learn something simple I usually turn to YouTube. But if I need to learn something major like a programming language, I used to go to Udemy, but honestly since I found coding phase most of the stuff I needed to learn you already have a video on so I just come to coding phase to learn major topics. 

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the fact that it's a challenge, I rather be trying to figure out a bug in my code than be at a warehouse stacking boxes.
### What do you hate about programming?

I hate that at times it could be difficult for a beginner to find a job, and I also hate that there is a lot of bad information on the internet on how to get a job.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Currently I am not working as a developer, But my goal is to start applying within the next 3 months.
### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I found php fun, I also enjoyed using Node JS, but there aren't many jobs in my area looking for that at the time.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I hear everybody talk about react and I've never tried it, so that's something I'd like to work with in the future

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years I see myself working for a company as a web developer, while also working on trying to start my own business so I can be my own boss

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

If I could go back in time I'd tell myself not to quit. I know that sounds cliche, but there was a time in my life that I stopped coding because of a situation I was in, and on top of that I felt like I wasn't good enough so I went years without coding until one day I picked it back up again and I've been on a path of re-learning what I once knew and learning new things.
