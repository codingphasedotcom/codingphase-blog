### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, nice to meet you - my name is Kevin Windisch. I'm 31 years old and I'm from Colorado Springs, CO, but I am now residing in Western Mass, New England.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I got interested in programming when I stumbled upon the Codingphase YouTube channel,
where I was watching live streams and videos. I realised there is so much information on there and I love to learn, so it was hard not to get interested.

### When did you start learning to code?

29 days ago, since joining the Codingphase developer community. Back then, I had no experience, zero knowledge and I never really got my hands dirty but now I'm feeling really comfortable with the basics.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I am a research kind of guy, so I actually use multiple sources to learn from. I'm mostly learning on the Codingphase platform, but I also use Google, YouTube and W3Schools.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I'll just take this time to quote what Joe said in a live stream one day - that "You can create gold." I realized that he was actually right. You can, if you wanted to, create a potential business with the skills that are learned as a developer. I want to create my own business one day with my skills that I am learning here, so, I love the fact that you can build an empire, from the ground up, if you're hungry enough.

### What do you hate about programming?

Hmm, definitely the curly-bracket nesting nightmare!

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am not. In fact, I am nowhere near the tech industry at all, but I am hoping to call myself a developer in about another month or two, tops.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I only know HTML, CSS, and maybe a drop of JS. My favorite applications are content creator apps, such as infographic designers or quote creators.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn JS thoroughly, as well as React Native.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I'm seeing a lot of progress within me, for a 29 day student - where I see myself in 5 years is to create custom websites, design my own website, getting a job as a Web Developer and using that income stream to create my own businesses. The average millionaire emerges at 62 years old, but only 1% of millionaires are under the age of 35. I want to be a millionaire in 5 years. I'm shooting for that.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't give up. Learn the basics and get comfortable with that before checking out the shiny stuff. The cool languages are really tempting to learn, but the basics are foundational and very important. Definitely be consistent and learn how to use a dev kit and set that up first before diving into anything else.
