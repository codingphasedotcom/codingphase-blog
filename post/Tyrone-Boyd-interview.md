### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello my name is Tyrone Boyd and I'm 22 years old out of Tampa,Florida.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I always knew I wanted to do something with computers and as I got older I was exposed to more and more programming.

### When did you start learning to code?

I first started to learn to code when I attended Daytona State College. It was just a basic Python coding class.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Since I graduated in the spring with a B.S. in I.T., CodingPhase has been my main source when it comes to learning new skills.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The thing I love most about coding is how everything can
come together sort of like puzzle pieces. It reminds me a
lot of when I was a Lego fanatic and just starting from
nothing then by the end you have a full project complete that you can be proud of.

### What do you hate about programming?

The thing I hate most about programming is how it is taught in a lot of places. I found myself disinterested a lot through college because the material was taught in a very dry way so of course. Luckily I found CodingPhase where I think the material is broken down in a way that makes things easier to understand. I feel like more light bulbs have gone off than anything I learned through classes

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am not currently working as a developer but I'm going hard every day to get to the point where I can secure a developer position.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't really have a favorite stack or type of application.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I definitely want to learn more JS in the future. I feel like getting more understanding would really push my skills as a developer that much further.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years I see myself working somewhere as a developer, I also want to build my own thing on the side so I can gain the freedom of being independent of any company.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

My advice would be to not let the boring "let's create a diamond out of asterisks" classes deter you from digging deeper and finding what really is something that is amazing.
