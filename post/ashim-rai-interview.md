### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Ashim Rai, I am from the United Kingdom and am 25 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

Chris Sean's video about how he became a developer in 3 months really piques my interest in learning
programming again as I had tried to learn it back in university to no avail.

### When did you start learning to code?

I first started learning to code when I was 20 years old at that it time I didn't find it very interesting.
I started to properly learn to code when I was 23 years old.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Currently I'm learning from codingphase academy but also have purchased some course on Udemy that was
recommended by Joe. Another platform I'm try out is Mike Locke's UX courses on WordPress.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the challenge of trying to solve problems and also learning new skills that can help me in my career
as a developer hopefully in the not so distant future.

### What do you hate about programming?

At this moment in time there is nothing I hate about programming, but my answer could change in the future.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am not currently working as developer yet, I am currently looking to learn JavaScript and PHP point
I am able to first create a portfolio website and also brush up my interview skill.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I currently haven't gotten that far in terms of my skill level so am unable to answer
this question

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

javascript frameworks and back-end languages like PHP

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

working as a full-stack developer trying to make various businesses to generate passive income

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

It would be better to learn slow in the beginning to grasp all of the concepts than try and rush through the
language that you are learning. Also ignore all the noise about the latest frameworks as you can learn them
in the near future, especially if you are just trying to get in the industry, just focus on the languages
that are essential to get you hired in the company that you are looking into.
