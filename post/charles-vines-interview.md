### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello my name is Charles.  I am originally from Atlantic City, NJ but now I live out in Philadelphia.  I am 28 years old and I am an aspiring freelance developer

### How did you get interested in programming?

I became interested in programming when I started my own fashion blog thefitgentleman.com.  I started it on wordpress but I couldn't do all the crazy ideas I had for it.  So I said to myself that I would learn how to code just to learn a few different tricks and it turned into a complete obsession.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning how to code back in 2018 but more recently got serious about it a few months ago.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I started out on codecademy but it was a little too childlike for me. Just a little too much hand holding.  Then I did free code camp and it was cool but I felt like there were things and explanations missing in the curriculum. I would fly through the problems and then when the projects got here I felt like I didn't retain any info.  That's when I started using Udemy and CodingPhase after your live stream challenging people to buy the plan for a dollar the first month. What I love about udemy and codingphase is you can build projects that you'll be working with in the real world not todo lists and color games.  And I get to watch someone build it in real time with mistakes and all which shows you that even the most seasoned vets make mistakes.

### What do you love the most about programming?

My favorite thing about programming is the creation aspect of it.  That you can take a blank page and make something appear on screen that wasn't there before.  Before this I was really into art and drawing so the fact that I can do that digitally for the world to see is amazaing to me.

### What do you hate about programming?

While it is great that there isn't one ridgid way of doing things. You can have a problem and find 100 different solutions that solves the issue. It can be a bit overwhelming especially for a beginner.  You have this one specific problem and you look it up on google and you have one blog post telling you one thing, stack overflow saying something in a language you've never seen before, a random messageboard says something else and the people that have responded to the message are calling the individual an idiot(gotta love the internet).  It can get a little confusing and deflating to some people who don't know yet how to traverse that type of ecosystem.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am currently applying to jobs while also taking on freelance work.  I have already landed a couple clients and using these first few clients along with the coding phase curriculum to make a dope portfolio to show people what I can do.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Right now I'm working as a frontend developer so my skills now are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn Node.js and React because that is what seems like is in demand right now.  After that I want to learn how to make dope physics based video games and Augmented Reality games and apps in Unity. I also want to learn about A.I. and machine learning.  I also want to make dope projects around the house using a raspberry pi to create things like smart mirrors, arcade cabinets, and pocket emulators.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself working for myself as a Freelance Web Developer living out west(Scottsdale) making dope things for amazing clients.  I would also like to have a mentoring program teaching other kids and teenagers who don't have access to these things. I want to show them that there are other ways of making really good money outside of entertainment, athletics, or illegal activities.  

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would just tell myself stop playing around and focus.  And besides looking on YouTube and Google on what's the best thing to do I would just choose one thing and stick with it and move to the next.  You can learn everything that you think is cool but you can't do it in one day.  So focus on the task at hand and take it one day at a time. It gets easier.
