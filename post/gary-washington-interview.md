### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Man first of all, I just want to say it's a big big honor, and it's my pleasure to be interviewed by the real OG of this coding game, Joe Santos Garcia, the creator of CodingPhase.com, The #1 Place on the Planet to teach you how to learn programming and go get paid! No starving programmers on this side of the street! We're eating and going back for seconds! With that being said, My name is Gary Washington Jr. I'm a passionate 28 years old african american male, living in the Atlanta Metro area in Clarkston, GA., and I've never been more excited about life, and what it holds for me. I'm just thankful to God for a new day, and the opportunity to take it to the next level. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

So basically, it came down to deciding what I wanted out of life, then what it would take to get there. No other career offers the ability to jump income classes like coding does. I saw how alot of immigrants came to the US and used programming as a vehicle to propel them into living great lives in America, so I asked myself what is the most efficient way to become a bonafide developer and land a job. Fortunately that search lead me to Joe's program at Codingphase.com. I picked up the yearly subscription the next day.

### When did you start learning to code?

After investing into Codingphase.com Mar 6 2021. 

### Where do you learn new skills?

In the field. I vet information, and then you have to get up, and go see if it works by doing it. I practice active learning. I never succumb to my ego and sense of self-importance, to the point where it hinders me from making progress. I humble myself to learn from the greats who have came before me. Been there did that, and can streamline my growth as a man.

### What do you love the most about programming?

You can get paid like a skilled tradesman essentially by typing, pointing and clicking a mouse. Come on, that's absolutely incredible!

### What do you hate about programming?

The fact that a lot of your learning comes from troubleshooting problems in your code. It takes time, but it's worth it.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Currently I'm developing my portfolio, and I plan to take a position as an email developer within the next 2 months. 

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I'm loving CSS, and Sass. It's one of my daily affirmations for this goal. "I see myself easily using html and css to build html emails it's so easy."

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Looking forward to adding Vanilla Javascript to my repertoire, getting a handle of the fundamentals, then diving into frameworks like Bulma, and Foundation for emails.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Working, doing what I love, going hard, taking a look around and seeing that it all paid off. I grab a nice glass of wine, and take a moment to enjoy my success, soaking it all in. I thank God that I got to see it. Then I get back to work.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

It's all about you. Everybody can't go. Pay now or pay later. There's no satisfaction without action. Focus on the few not the many. Play to win instead of playing not to lose. Enjoy the process. Have a good time. Learn enough code to get a job in this industry, don't wait.
