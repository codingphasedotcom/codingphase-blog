### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is, Christopher Leveston. I am a graphic designer and illustrator
and find web development to be really fun. Getting back into it and want to take my
career further with this.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've watched various youtubers that motivated me to really start learning. I like how you
can make a good living off of developing and designing web pages. Freelancing and improving my 
design business to develop websites for individuals is a must. Being able to sit out on 
the beach and work on a mac making a bag sounds like the dream LOL.

### When did you start learning to code?

I actually dipped into coding when I was like 17. I would play around with languages like C++. Make 
funny little text-based games. I stopped until I found out that web development not only was about coding, but
also design, which over the years I've gained graphic design knowledge and knowing this got me very interested.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Usually from books and the internet. But I'm definitely going to learn web dev from codingphase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

Problem solving and seeing things work.

### What do you hate about programming?

When stuff get broken and I spend hours trying to figure what I did wrong, only for it to be something super
small and simple.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am currently not working as a developer.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I see MERN pretty interesting.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

React

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

A web developer. Not having to worry about bills LOL!

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

If I could go back in time, I would tell my younger self to get into web development instead of playing with the other languages at that time.
