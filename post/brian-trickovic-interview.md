### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi! My name is Brian Trickovic. I am 24 years old and living in Arlington, VA—a county located across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. I am originally from the New York metropolitan area.

### How did you get interested in programming?

What interested me in programming was when I realized that its creative potential has no limits. As Hal Abelson has alluded to—programmers are like sorcerers, and programming languages are like the spell books we use to conjure up magical powers. With programming, the only limits are what humans can think in their minds. I love building, and that creative potential inspires me to get involved in programming with like-minded developers.

### When did you start learning to code?

I first dabbled with coding at the age of 19. However, this year (2021), I decided to have a professional career in programming. Thus, my knowledge base on the subject has built up far more compared to previous years.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I learn new skills from various resources—books, documentation, courses, videos, and more.

### What do you love the most about programming?

What I love most about programming is the opportunity to be a builder to the fullest extent that you want to be, as I suggested when I described what interested me in programming. But another thing I love about programming is that it makes you grow as a person. As a programmer, you get to observe firsthand how our world is changing. To remain successful in performing your duties, you realize you need to change & adapt as the world changes—developing maturity.

### What do you hate about programming?

What I hate about programming is that it could be difficult to learn without a successful professional to teach you the ropes of the industry. Not only because some concepts might be tough, but also because, as a newbie, you can't tell whether which concepts are important to learn, not a priority, or obsolete. There is a lot of random information in the world, and studying the wrong things can unnecessarily burn you out.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

I am not currently working as a developer, but I plan on landing a developer role soon!

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite library is React.js

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I wish to be more familiar with React.js, C++, and Python in the future.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself as a seasoned industry professional working as a senior software engineer.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would say, "buy CodePhase's yearly subscription and start with the courses there."
