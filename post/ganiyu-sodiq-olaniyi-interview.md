### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my nage is Ganiyu Sodiq Olaniyi. I am from Oyo State, Nigeria. And I am 27 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I have always wanted the ability to build things right from my childhood.

### When did you start learning to code?

I did some programming course while I was in higher institution.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I discovered codingphase.com in few days back and it has been my go to source for learning new skills. I am going to take some courses on Udemy in the future because Joe has some good recommendations there.

### What do you love the most about programming?

What I love most is the is that it gives me the skill to translate my ideas into reality. I can build my ideas into being.

### What do you hate about programming?

What I hate most is also one of the things that makes it interesting. It is the frustration I feel when my program doesnt run as I expect, and that can be the cause of an interesting feeling too when I later find the solution to make the program run as expected.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No. I believe I will get a programming Job befoe the end of next year.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I am just starting out on my web dev journey however, the MEAN stack is something I wish to know and use more often.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

MEAN Stack and Java Spring. I understand that the too arent related. Java is something I've always wanted to use.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself working as a senior developer is a nice company while I have many online projects that are helping people and making me passive income in the process. I also want to have blog where many newbies and pro will learn from my experience and knowledge.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

It will be 'start now and don't stop learning and implementing what you learn'. I wish I had started learning how to code ten years back.
