### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Maria Cromety. I am 34 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

That's a very good question, I was interested in programming because when I saw the Apple websites and their Apple programs I wanted to learn how to program and I've heard so many stories how you can work from home and still make a living.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn to code in 2017, Through a website called
udemy.com But over time I didn't understand how to really code because it seemed as if every instructor gave so many technical information which made me wonder am I really good at coding and when I couldn't understand I went through so many other courses to see if I can understand, but I never understood at the time. Which fast forward three years later, I found codingphase through a YouTube video and I decided to give it a shot because I didn't want to give up on becoming a coder.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I've learned so many new skills through the coding phase platform. It has given me not only you the coding aspect, but also confidence that I can be able to code. Even though I have a long journey ahead of me, I am so glad I am within the coding phase platform.

### What do you love the most about programming?

To be honest with you, I'm still trying to figure out what I love about programming because I'm not the type of person who has been coding ever since they've been a kid or a teenager. What I can tell you... is that the further I go within the coding journey I can say what I like the most about coding so far is that you can make anything you want that's what I like so far about programming. Also, I like being challenged and once I do figure out that challenge within the programming aspect, it makes me so happy I'm like brushing off my shoulders every time I figure out the problem or find a solution.

### What do you hate about programming?

to be honest, I don't know if I can say I hate anything about programming as of yet because I'm still learning programming. I can say what I dislike about programming so far is that... The little errors such as if you miss a semicolon or comma it'll screw up your code and you're sitting there wondering what the problem is, when you see it is a semicolon that caused the issue it... just makes me laugh and I always say to myself I should've seen that it would have saved me a lot of time.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Sadly no, not at the moment I am not working as a developer as of yet. I would love to work as a developer as soon as possible but I know programming is not something that can be rushed, so I have to be patient and everything will fall into place.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite is stack or type of application is Shopify. I love seeing so many videos, tutorials regarding Shopify and it just amazes me how you can make Shopify themes for different e-commerce.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Shopify theme development

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Where do I see myself in five years that's a good question, I see myself owning my own web development company and having other upcoming developers working along with me. Because I grew up not knowing what I wanted to do growing up and I tried so many computer related endeavors. Going back to the original question, I want to be able to work for myself because I don't want to always work for another person following what they tell me what to do and how to do it. I want to be able to take The skills I've learned from a company giving me the opportunity to learn and implement it In a better way on the side. How do you see in the future, my web development company giving me the ability not only to travel, see the world, but help others and travel and see the world give them something to fall back on later on in life.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Always do your research thoroughly because there's always a better option out there then just the bare minimum. The reason why I say this, it's because I stuck with so many options previous options that didn't feel right and I felt it in my gut, but just ignored it because I didn't want to fail at it. But if it doesn't feel right, it's usually not right and learning the code is something that it's truly something you will have to do your research and patience is the key because every coding Boot Camp or every coding course out there is not always the right course for you, even though they may advertise that they are best course out there.
