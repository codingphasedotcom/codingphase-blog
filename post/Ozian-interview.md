### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

What's up! Ozian here. I'm 37 from NZ and I got 2 young kids.

### How did you get interested in programming?

November 2018 I suffered a spinal injury. I spent a month having 
to lay flat on my back, not being able sit up, stand, or walk.
As we all know, life doesn't care about your circumstances, 
it still keeps rolling on. The kids still need to be fed and bills still need to be paid.
So I wasn't just gonna lay down and lose. I started looking for careers
that didn't need me to be so physical anymore. Long story short, I came across a video
on youtube where the guy I was watching told me I wasn't too old to learn to code.
I downloaded my first code editor, followed along with a tutorial, put my first h1 tag up 
with "hello" and I was hooked.


### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning a couple months ago. During this time I had to figure
out how structure my day so my kids were happy and I could learn to code.
When I first started learning I would get up at 5:30am - 6am, get my kids dressed,
make them breakfast, sit down and code for a couple hours, put the youngest one to sleep,
code, make lunch for us, clean up, play with the kids, code. Make dinner, clean up, bath the kids,
code, play with the kids, put the kids to bed, code untill 2 -3am (3am if Codingphase is live streaming lol). Get up at 5:30am and repeat. EVERYDAY.
Now, I did eventually kind of burnout doing this, it didn't discouraged me from coding, it just meant 
I had to find a better structure for myself. So I basically compressed all of that into a day where I
 could finish the day at 11pm get a good nights rest and get back into it the next day. I found I could
 remember what I learned more clearly doing it this way too.

### Where do you learn new skills?

My first google search for learning how to code was "am I too old to learn how to code". At 37 years of age
thats a real question to be asking yourself if you've never worked in the tech industry 
before.  When I found the codingphase youtube channel, the whole game changed up for me.
Codingphase, to me was really relatable. It was like watching someone I grew up with talk 
to me about becoming a developer. So I do all of my learning at codingphase.com



### What do you love the most about programming?

For the first time in a long time I wake up looking forward to what I'm gonna learn
 and do for the day. I love the creativity side of programming. 
 The fact that you can tell this thing what to do and it will do it.
 And if it doesn't do what you "thought" you told it to do, then you gotta go find out why.
 Adjust where you need to and move on to the next stage. 


### What do you hate about programming?
The fact that you can tell this thing what to do and it will do it.
 And if it doesn't do what you "thought" you told it to do, then you gotta go find out why.
 lol


### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, BUT I have started to build an e-commerce site for someone. It's a good way for me to 
practice what I've learned so far. No $ have been discussed so technically I'm not yet 'working'
as a developer.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

At the moment it's the front end stuff. I want to start building a messenger app.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn REACT because thats what most companies are looking for where I live.


### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Having my own company, bringing my people up, letting them know 
that development IS AN OPTION for them to pursue as a career
 instead of just the usual dirty, gritty jobs we're told are the only options 
available to us.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

dont try to learn too much stuff at one time. Pick a stack and focus on that stack.
