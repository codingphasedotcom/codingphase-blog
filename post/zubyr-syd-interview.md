### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name is Zubyr Syd, from Toronto, Ontario.  

### How did you get interested in programming?

I have had passion for art in various forms in different stages of my life. Started with hip hop dancing in high school, transitioned into working out, and eventually into making hip hop music, producing my own beats, and making video games via unity engine. Apart from my parents expectations, I found real interest in programming when I saw what Joe Garcia of Codingphase.com was able to accomplish with programming skills. I realized its not just a tool for the corporate world but it can be used to create interfaces and things that can express art in our digitally modernized age. I believe programming can be used to create arts in several forms (music, video games, etc).

### When did you start learning to code?

I started officially learning to program when I came into my first year of college.

### Where do you learn new skills?

All coding skills from youtube, geeksforgeeks, and Udemy.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The fact that I can program and create beautiful art expressed through video games. Programming tools to make amazing games like Skyrim: the one game I play to this very day is Skyrim whose graphics and envronmental beauty keeps me in awe thinking "WOW, code made this??!!".

### What do you hate about programming?

there are too many ways to go about a solution that I are implemented several different ways that I lack conceptual knowledge in which discourages me to trying that solution unless I've tried all other solutions that are more simpler to understand.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, aiming to finish all front end courses and start applying asap.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

front-end development (visual heavy like html/css, android app development, and C#/Unity/Unreal Engine)

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn to become proficient in the coding video game concepts so C# and Unity engine gaming projects would be cool to see from codinghpase.com.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Doing front end developer job while making video games on the side, and other side incomes. 

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't try to learn everything at once. Pick one project to code at a time, and eventually trial and error until you can choose proficient languages and tools for whats possible to express art in the field of programming (in my case is video game programming and graphic design).
