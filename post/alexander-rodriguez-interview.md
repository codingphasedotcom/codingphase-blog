### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Alex. I am from Baltimore, Maryland and I am 28 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I was looking for a new career path when I noticed these cyber breaches happening a lot lately. So I started becoming interested in cyber security and tech in general. I stumbled upon some python tutorials while learning about cyber security and I fell in love with the coding aspect. I ended up persuing software development instead of cyber security because I found it to be more enjoyable and creative.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning the basics of coding in 2015.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Through online articles, courses, and books.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The ability to create something from nothing and learning about how software.

### What do you hate about programming?

When something does not work as intended and I cannot figure out why.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't have one.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

VR, AR, and machine learning.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Starting a family and investing my money into stocks & bonds.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would stick with one course instead of learning from multiple sources. Also just apply to jobs, don't try to master everything first.
