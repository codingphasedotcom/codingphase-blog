I'd say don't waste time following the tutorials step by step. I know it feels like that you're accomplishing something and that you feel safe but stop it! You are slowing down your learning process. You need to know why things do what they do. You have to build something no matter how small. Start with maybe a menu-bar. If you get stuck do a google search. Build something sounmds real cliche but it's the truth!
