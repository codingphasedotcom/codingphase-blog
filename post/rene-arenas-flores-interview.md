### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello I am Rene Arenas Flores from New Jersey and I am 36 years old. I have followed Joe since 2017 and really like the CodingPhase program.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I really got interested way back in the late 1990's when I got my very own AOL cd and was able to install it and login. This was great to surf the web and eventually found geocities and I made my self a little super simple page. My page looked like it was from the early 90's though instead of the late 90's. Well this gave me exposure to html and logins and to some extent page layout. Ever since then I have been interested in tech.

### When did you start learning to code?

Well to really learn code I started in 2017-2018. My first line I remember was a h1 tag and space background back in the geocities days 1997.

### Where do you learn new skills?

CodingPhase is now my primary source, although I do use Udemy and Youtube and alse freecodecamp and sololearn have been good. But I always come back to CodingPhase, Joe puts allot of good work into the courses.

### What do you love the most about programming?

That you can work with others to build something great or if you have a idea you can develop it yourself. It is also cool working with tech. 

### What do you hate about programming?

Nothing really, so far with the experience I have there has been nothing to hate on. Maybe when I have been here a while and see little things here and there that might, but right now its all great and really rewarding too.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Nope, not yet. But working on it everyday.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I would say the LAMP only becuase right now I use linux mint 19 and that is the only stack I have been exposed to so far. 

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would Like to learn PHP and also wordpress and HTML emails as well as JavaScript and MySQL. These seem very good because at CodingPhase there are courses on this and it will help me in my career.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Getting together with a group of Developers?Entrapenuers to start a buisness.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Keep building everyday, don't let a day go by without out coding, treat it like air you need to have it everyday.
