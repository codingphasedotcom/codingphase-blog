### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Saluton mondo! I'm Blake from Texas. I'm currently 50.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I got into building websites with HTML back in college. I saw a friend building a website in the computer lab. I thought it was cool and something I wanted to do.

### When did you start learning to code?

Back in the late 1990s, and then I went back to learning coding in 2011.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Present tense. Coding Phase and Udemy.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The creativity. I used to draw and play guitar all the time, so I resonate with the moniker Rock Star Developer.

### What do you hate about programming?

Nothing really, just having to do things differently as certain features become deprecated.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No. I'm looking to get into the industry. However, it's hard when one doesn't have personal or professional projects to show in their portfolio, and that's why I went with Coding Phase.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. MERN is also a good stack, but a library like Svelte might replace React in the near future.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Julia.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Living overseas most likely, somewhere the USD goes further and yet where it's relatively safe to live. Professionally, making 6+ figures a year either as a developer or an entrepreneur.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Get a mentor. Apply for as many jobs as you can just to get your foot in the door. Go to more networking events.
