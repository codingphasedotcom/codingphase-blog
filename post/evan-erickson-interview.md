### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my name is Evan. I'm 25 years old and live in Orange County, CA. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

I worked in investment banking and for software billionaires. I realized that if I wanted to start my own business, that programming was the way to do it. We live in a new world, and programming is one of the best fields to get into.

### When did you start learning to code?

About a year ago

### Where do you learn new skills?

I've started with StudioWeb by Stefan Mischook and recently I began my journey with codingphase.com

### What do you love the most about programming?

The ability to work from anywhere and not be tied down to a 9 to 5.

### What do you hate about programming?

Installing packages via the command line. Sometimes it works out and is easy, but when you get errors... all hell breaks loose.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, I'm still studying. I finished my first website, www.politicalsingularity.com, which is focused on news and politics. Now I am developing my personal webpage, evanserickson.com, and an ecommerce page.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Right now, just the web stack. I'm slowly getting into the foundation framework and other HTML templates.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I'd like to perfect my JS, and then move to Swift for mobile development. In the medium term, I'd like to learn AI and somehow merge webdev with AI.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Traveling through Asia with a wife and child. Supporting my family through programming and side businesses. I will have a few sources of passive revenue too.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't take as many notes in the beginning. Just watch the videos, learn the concepts, and practice. Also, start developing real websites sooner.
