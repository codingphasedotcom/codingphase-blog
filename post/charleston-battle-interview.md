### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello my name is Charleston Battle. I'm born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. I am currently 33 years old. I enjoy Gamming, Outloors (also cycling long distance whenever I get the chance lol).

### How did you get interested in programming?

I believe I was interested in programming when I was in highschool, but my peers and school staff told me that I couldn't do it because you have to be some kind of High IQ top of the line math wiz; and because of my grades at that time, it wasn't going to be a good fit for me. This was when we actually had something called career centers. A year later after my highschool graduation, I came across a few books in the library on Programming books. I thought to myself "If this was supposed to be this highly complicated subject, the why are these books displayed in a public library?". My 1st book was "C++ For Dummies" and it came with a disk with a free compiler. I followed the basice out of the book, and I was able to compresensivly follow along. I realized that I didn't have to have a high IQ in math, it was just that the public school system didn't care to help me explore what I was truly interested in. This is why I don't like Public Schools and Common Core.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started coding a year after my highschool graduation 2015.

### Where do you learn new skills?

When it comes to technology, I definately use the internet. Come to think of it, almost any information lives on the internet.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The journey and how the code grow and change by the strokes of keys on the keyboard, with the understanding that the growth and change is done by you. I also love that you are mostly left alone to do your work.

### What do you hate about programming?

For right now it is the getting stuck part. But I do hear a lot of horror stories about constant meetings where the devs can't get anything done under tight deadlines.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, I currently work Help Desk and I hate it. Mortgage Banker call in and talk to you like you are nothing and demand that you do their job. It's not my job to re-purpose your loan, that is not what I signed up for. My job is to fix your laptop or system issues related to your application, not "should I lock the loan rate at this percent or that percent". I don't know that. Then you get push back when you tell them that, then its more time on the phone with the person you don't want to be on the phone with. So yeah, This is the last time I will ever work Help Desk, off the phones forever.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't currently have one at the time. I'm still exploring. But for the time being I would say JavaScript because of how far it came and readibility.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

node.js

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Self-Employed with residual passive income.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Just code and don't put it on the back-burner and understand that you do not need a collage degree to code.
