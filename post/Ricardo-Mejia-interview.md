Hi there, my name is Ricardo Mejia. I was born in Dominican Republic and moved over to Florida about 14 years ago. I now live in the beautiful city of St Petersburg Florida. I came here for college and decided to stay in the area. After I graduated, I started looking for jobs in the Tampa Bay are and wasn't having much luck. I graduated with two majors and three minors and 5 years of work experience. Those fields were focused around finance, management and you would think that puts you in a good spot, but it doesn't do much when you look at the numbers.

About 4.5 million students graduate from college each year while 2018 was the highest year for job growth topping at 2.6 million... To make things worse most of that job growth is mostly low wage jobs. Those numbers opened my eyes and made me realize the immense amount of competition I was in. When I looked at LinknedIn's metrics of who was applying to the jobs I was applying to the picture got even dimmer. For 80% of the jobs I applied to there were people with sr. status applying to those jobs. This tell you that even people at the Sr. level are struggling to find jobs. 

This drove me to rethink everything. Is putting all this work into finding a job that's not even going to pay much in the long run worth it? Unless you work for a big hedge fund, you won't be making more than 100k in finance and that only comes after 10-15 years of a lot of sucking up. This is an industry that connections matter more than skills, another reason why it made it difficult to find a job. I have big goals that require a lot of capital. I want to have at least 30 eco-villages in Dominican Republic to help feed people sustainably. I was planning on saving everything I earned and invest in real estate properties to make passive income, not rely on a job and start on the first eco-village. In 30 years, I could have accomplished that goal according to my calculations.  

I did more research and looked at the jobs that are most in demand and have the highest job growth. According to most of the data out there, software development is where is at. What gives this field an advantage is that the pool of the population trying to get into the field is lower than most and software development is the future of the job market. Lucky for us that means that software development is one of the fields that gets paid the most. I did some more calculations and saw that I could accomplish my goals 10-15 years earlier. In 2-5 years, you could easily be making +$100k! To make things even better, the cost and time to learn is MAD low!

Right before Christmas, I made up my mind and decided to try it out. I started learning with Code Academy, it was cool at first, but I felt like I wasn’t learning well with them. They didn’t explain the concepts well and the projects were trash! I bumped into Coding Phase on YouTube and I really liked how real Joe was. He put everything in the most honest way instead of hyping things up like most other Youtubers were doing. On top of that, the price for his courses were mad cheap. So, I tried it out and fell in love with it. The concepts are explained thoroughly, and the projects were at a professional level. I’m planning on taking the full stack route, learning JS, React, Angular, PHP, Node JS and whatever else strikes my interest. So, between Coding Phase and google is where I’m spending my time learning.

What I love most about programming is that I thought is was so hard and would never like it. Now that I’m a few weeks in I’m really loving it. I love the fact that I have so much control of a website. It’s really cool seeing the finished result and how you can take a design and replicate it or mix it up. Although it can really get frustrating at times when you get stuck and it’s usually for something really small or dumb. But it reminds you that it’s not too hard you just got to keep working at it and find the solution, it’s always out there somewhere. 5 years from now I see myself buying my 3rd or 4th property, working at a nice job making over 100k. My parents won’t be stressed out with too many bills and I will be able to help the rest of my family in Dominican Republic
