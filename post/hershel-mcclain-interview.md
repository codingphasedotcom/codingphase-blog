### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello. My name is Hershel McClain. I live in Indianapolis, In. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've had a few jobs working in a Help Desk capacity. Therein, I learned that
I like webpage development. 

### When did you start learning to code?

I've been playing with html, css, and bootstrap for the past year. I learned some of the 
html basics years ago, but never took a consider interest in website design until recently.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Mostly Youtube.

### What do you love the most about programming?

To create a digital message that the world can appreciate.

### What do you hate about programming?

So far, good tutorail sources for beginers. Understanding what's going on inside the 
minds of beginers is key for the grooming of future teammates. 

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No. Still trying to get a few sites and project components together.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

None at the moment. I do have my eye on JS and React Native.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

PhP and Larvel

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Working as a creative full stack developer. Hopefully, by this point
I will have memberships in a few good developer teams to keep one's skills
current.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Find a person you have an ear for and try to give them a shot for 90 days non-stop.
If you get stuck, start to ask more questions on the post and timelines.
Don't be too shy to ask questions on platforms. Try to complete one project per month.
