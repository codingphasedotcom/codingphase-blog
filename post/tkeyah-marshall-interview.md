### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is T'keyah. I'm 25 years old and living in South Jersey.

### How did you get interested in programming?

My dad is a network administrator and long time tech geek, he passed it on I guess.

### When did you start learning to code?

MySpace.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Mainly CodingPhase, Udemy and free resources online.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love that programming is a lot easier than it looks once you learn the basics.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate that some text editors glitch out and make you doubt yourself/ability to follow directions. I once spent over a week deleting and re-typing css trying to fix one section, only to drop the code into a new editor and have no issues.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, I am looking.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Web browsers are what I'm trying to conquer at the moment.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn Photoshop and other photo editors like Autodesk. I want to work in web design and I still only know the bare bones of these apps.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Coding for at least 4 years already, comfortably from my home office in my townhouse.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't get discouraged, keep going. Utilize online communities.
