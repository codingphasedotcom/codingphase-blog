### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hey, my name's Adam, I'm from Rhode Island and I'm 33 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I tried to go through school for video game design and had some classes that taught html and css.
Had to give up going to school because I didn't have the money to continue, but was still interested in
what I had been learning. Taking it upon myself to fully learn how to code, get a good paying job, then
go back to school when I can afford it.

### When did you start learning to code?

In college before I had to stop going. There was html, css, a little javascript, and a little c++.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Learning them through codingphase and websites like stackoverflow if I need to figure something out

### What do you love the most about programming?

The feeling of accomplishment when you make something cool happen either visually or functionally

### What do you hate about programming?

It has a steep learning curve

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I prefer front end but I have had very little experience with the back end so I can't say whether I'll like
it better or not

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to have a good grip on javascript and for the sake of having a good paying job, maybe php or java

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

With a job that pays well and doesn't make me miserable, or alternatively, running my own business

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

No matter what point in my life I went back into, I would tell myself to start much earlier and to stick
with it. At 33, I'm still not too old but I could also be at a much better place in my life if I hadn't started so late.
