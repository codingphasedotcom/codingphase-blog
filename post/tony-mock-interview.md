### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, I'm Tony, I'm currently in Florida. I am 27 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I became interested in programming in highschool when I was first introduced to html. I never pursued it. But fell back in recently when I landed on a video of going from no degree to programmer featuring Joe in an interview. It inspired me to pick it back up and have been at it for a month so far.

### When did you start learning to code?

I would say truly learning just recently. But I've had brief introductions to it in my youth.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Google.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I can become self-made. Just like the software I create.

### What do you hate about programming?

Not having enough time in the day to do so.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, but I am seeking to become one soon.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I don't know what a stack is yet. I am only familiar with the term in reference. Getting there though, you'll see.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Near future I plan to learn Javascript and SQL.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Running multiple forms of businesses and being able to travel.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't stop after that html course you liked. Don't be afraid to learn about computers, it's not only for really smart people.
