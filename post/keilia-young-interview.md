### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

    Hi, my name is Keilia.  I currently reside in Atlanta, GA.  And, I'm 33 years young.

### How did you get interested in programming?

    My interest in programming was planted in 2017.  I was looking for a job/career change that gives me the flexibility of working from anywhere, and one that was very different from what I'm used to.  I began searching on Youtube, and lo and behold, programming and I locked eyes. 

### When did you start learning to code?

    I started learning to code in 2017.

### Where do you learn new skills?

    So far, the skills I've acquired are through Youtube, Code Academy, CareerFoundry, and Coding Phase.
### What do you love the most about programming?

    I love that it reminds me of a jigsaw puzzle, like an infinite piece puzzle.  I love that a missing comma, or semi-colon can have such a great impact on the whole structure.  It teaches that everything has a place, and plays an important role for the end result to be a successful one.
### What do you hate about programming?

    I hate the fimposter feeling that comes along with the career on a whole, and the feeling of not being entirely sure if what I'm learning is being absorbed and/or sticking.
### Are you currently working as a developer?

    Not at the moment, but would love to start as soon as I'm done with this course.
### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

    So far in my short journey, I do like the basic HTML and CSS.
### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

    I would like to learn more about Python, React, and be more versed in Javascript.
### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

    In 5 years, I see myself as an accomplished HTML Email developer, and furthering my skills and education within this career field.
### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

    If I could go back in time and give myself any advice about learning code, I would tell myself that discipline and consistency are the key.
