### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my name is Keilia.  I currently reside in Lilburn, GA.  I'm 32 years young.

### How did you get interested in programming?

My interest in programming was planted in 2017.  I was looking for a job/career that I can do from anywhere, and one that was very different from what I'm used to.  I began searching on Youtube, and lo and behold, programming and I locked eyes. 

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to code in 2017.

### Where do you learn new skills?

So far, the skills I've acquired are through Youtube, Code Academy, CareerFoundry, and Coding Phase.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love that it reminds me of a jigsaw puzzle, like an infinite piece puzzle, but everything has a place.  

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate the feeling of not being entirely sure if what I'm learning is being absorbed and/or sticking. (Being a complete newbie to the field is rather intimidating.) 

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not at the moment, but would love to start as soon as I'm done with this course.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

So far in my short journey, I do like the basic HTML and CSS.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I would like to learn more about Python, and be more comfortable with Javascript.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years, I would love to be atleast comfortable in my web development skills, and career.   

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

If I could go back in time and give myself any advice about learning code, I would tell myself to be more discipline and consistent, and to not allow so much time in between learning.
