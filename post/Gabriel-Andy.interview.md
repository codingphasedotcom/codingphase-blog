### How did you get interested in programming?
I was watching one of the amaziest  channels CS Dojo, and I felt in love in the way that he was solving algorithms and datastructures problems even though I have 
no ideas what he was talking about. everything seems like math,and since I graduated in civil engineering 4 years ago and really love maths and problem solving , I decided to start learning code

I started learning on july 1,2019.

I started learning by the book called the head first by Oreilly, and from there I was moving from tutorials after tutorials to solve problem.
then I found codingphase and signed up for a yearly plus

The thing I really like about programming is the ability to create something that never existed in the past and shared it to the world.

### What do you hate about programming?

Sometimes, you come accross problem that in order to solve, you will have to move from place after place.
it might take hours,days and weeks,  and if you are not committed enough, you might feel a little burned out and therefore, you will probably give up
