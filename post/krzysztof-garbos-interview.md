Hi, my name is Krzysztof Garbos, I'm 24 and from Toronto, ON

I've always been interested in coding from a young age but it wasn't until University where I was invited to a hackathon and meant like minded people that were in the CS program.

I learn new skills from courses, youtube tutorials and trying things on my own or reading the documentation for certain technologies and lookng at code from github
