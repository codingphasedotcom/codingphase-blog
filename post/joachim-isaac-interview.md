In the future I would like to be proficient in Artificial intelligence and I wouldn't mind learning swift to make a few ios apps.
I would also want to be able to fuse webdevelopment with some ai algorithm that will create a nice online service.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

At a big company and working on side income so that I can be a baller.
