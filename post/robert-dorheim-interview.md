### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hello, my name is Robert. I am 44 yrs old and from Central California.

### How did you get interested in programming?

Coding looked interesting and I'll be very honest and say I'm trying to get into the industry for a big bag! I was forced to resign from education and in order to find freedom I am taking a calculated risk and changing careers.

### When did you start learning to code?

October 2021

### Where do you learn new skills?

FreeCodeCamp was a start, then I took a risk and signed onto Freemote. It's great but I sort of lost my way, not much of a freelancer as it stands. I started searching for another path. I found a Youtube video regarding HTML email jobs lead me to CodingPhase. I am truly excited at all this course content.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I think the artist in me enjoys seeing the changes made to website styles plus I just finished the animations course. It's awesome! Also it's challenging.

### What do you hate about programming?

The frustrated feeling you get where you've run into some form of error or conflict and the solutions won't work. To be fair I must not be truly challenging myself as I haven't been consistantly frustrated like this since High School.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, but I have a direction. Thanks to Joe. Word.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

CSS and now SCSS!!!

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Python maybe? 

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself happier, on a small farm with my animals. I see myself as a developer of some kind. Having moved on from HTML emails(maybe?)in search of a bigger bag. We will be much happier.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I'd say, "Robert, just start coding. Take a chance. Practice everyday. In the future you'll be forced to do things against your will simply because you have no desire to be "well off". For now money doesn't matter but in the future you will lose your job and those in power will not allow you to work. Thus you must equip yourself with skills that will allow you to make a living remotely. Work hard as you do and good luck young man.
