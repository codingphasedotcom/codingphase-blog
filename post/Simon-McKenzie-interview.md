### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Sup everyone! My name is Simon. I'm born and raised in Jacksonville, Fla (Duuuuuuval) and I'm currently 32yrs old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

A cousin of mine currently works at Google as a project manager and she honestly convinced me to learn how to code and programming in general. I've always been the type of person that wants to improve in all aspects of my life and in my current field I've made it to the top so life has become stagnant. Once I learned about how huge the tech field is and the how much programming can improve your life I instantly wanted more.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning around February 2022

### Where do you learn new skills?

Work, Love, Life, you name it lol

### What do you love the most about programming?

Being able to apply what I learn to topics and industries that I learn for fun, i.e. gaming, computers, and business.

### What do you hate about programming?

It can be challenging when you get stuck on a issue. Plus getting that first job is TOUGH.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I really like shopify. I believe knowing shopify can take you a long way in life.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

C#, I wish to eventually be a Unity Game/VR developer long-term wise

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years I see myself either working as a shopify developer making VR applications and shopify themes on the side, or a .Net developer doing the same type of side projects.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Focus on getting in the industry first, worry about moving up and ahead once you're in.
