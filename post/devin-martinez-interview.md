### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi, my name is Devin Martinez, and I'm 24 years old. Right now i'm based in the Boston area in Massachusetts.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I've been obsessed with tech all my life, but never knew anything about coding. It never really felt like something I could do. I ended up getting into digital marketing and decided to go to college for it. While applying, I saw that the school also had a degree for "Computer Information Systems", which could eventually be specialized into software development. I was curious, so I ended up doing some research on it and absolutely fell in love with the idea of coding and building things.

### When did you start learning to code?

I was planning to go to a bootcamp, but it didn't begin for another month or two. I decided that I could use the time to get a headstart and so I bought the same Colt Steele course that everyone does.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I got through about half of that course. While I learned a lot, it just didn't hook me the way I was hoping it would. So I looked around for other courses and videos on youtube and eventually came across CodingPhase. And it was exactly what I was looking for. I've been learning new skills on the website since.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The opportunity. There are a lot of jobs that you can go into if you want to make money. But I haven't found a single other field that: 1. Would let me in without a degree, and 2. Has anywhere near the same amount of possibilities once you learn the skill. I love how many paths programming opens, and how if you want to you can keep learning and keep increasing your paths.

### What do you hate about programming?

How abstract it can be at times. A lot of programming is topics that you can't see. So sometimes it's difficult to conceptualize what you're learning.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet! I'm very close to finishing the html email developer path, and that's where I plan to get my first job.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Considering I only know HTML, CSS, and JS (barely) so far, I'll say those.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to dive deep into JavaScript. I understand it on a basic level, and can work with it, but it can still be intimidating. But I can already tell how powerful it can be when you get into the more advanced concepts.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Right now the plan is to get my first job, then jump every 6-12 months for the pay raise and to learn new things at different places. During this time, I'll also be working on digital products, niche sites, and some SaaS ideas I have. That being said, it seems like the more I learn, the more paths I see that I can take, so those plans may change. Regardless, I plan to keep learning, growing, and building.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Focus! I spent a lot of time learning concepts just to learn them. While that was good, I could've saved a lot of time if I focused on getting that entry-level job, and learning only what I needed to to get that job. It wasn't until I got to CodingPhase that I developed a plan and really started learning what I needed to.
