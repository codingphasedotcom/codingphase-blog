### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hi my name is Ivan Stame.  I'm from Huntington Beach, California and I am 34 years old.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I used to create websites on services like Angelfire back in the day.  Went to college and studied liberal arts and then became a massage therapist.  I knew I couldn't keep massaging for my entire life since the earnings on that is pretty much capped at a certain limit that isn't too high and you can only earn money while you labor.  One day I found Joe on Youtube and that was a wrap for me.  Sign me up.

### When did you start learning to code?

Technically I started to code back in like 2000 with HTML table based layouts but I never learned CSS since it was brand new and I didn't know that I'd have an interest in going further with the hobby.  I bought a book on Java programming two years ago to get the basics of programming in general down and made the committment recently to becoming a web developer.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Coding Phase, Traversy Media, Lynda and Udemy for coding.  All other things I need to learn in life I do by attempting it for myself, messing up and then making course corrections.

### What do you love the most about programming?

The feeling you get once something clicks (no pun intended).  The element of creating something from nothing basically is also really rewarding.

### What do you hate about programming?

It reminds me daily that I've go to be humble and accept that I'm not as smart as I thought I was.  On top of that there is SO MUCH INFORMATION out there it feels overwhelming.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No, currently I'm working as a Massage Therapist.  I intend to make the switch in the first half of 2020 and be working as a full time web developer.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

I haven't been doing this long enough to have a favorite yet to be honest.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

Laravel and becoming really good at creating wordpress themes and websites for clients.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Owning and running my own Pay Per Click and Web Design business while earning money from multiple streams of passive income via microservices and nice websites.  I hope the money from this career change will allow me to support family.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't get caught up in being hard on yourself for not meeting your preconceived notions of what it means to be intelligent and trusting the process.  If I could go back I would have started learning this stuff in college and enjoyed the process and not compared myself to others.
