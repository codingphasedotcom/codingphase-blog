### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hey my name is Elin. I'm 30 years old and from New York City.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I got interested in programming when I found out that you didn't need a degree to work in the industry and that it was lucrative and similar to graphic design (something I used to do as a hobby when I was younger) in the way that you get paid for building visual things for internet users.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started to learn how to code but no seriously 2 years ago, took it serious this summer and put in a lot of effort to get good at the fundamentals.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I learn new skills from instructors like Joe at codingphase and I use content from other experienced instructors in the game also and self teaching through building.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love that it's challenging and rewarding at the same time, it allows you to be creative in a deep way.

### What do you hate about programming?

Nothing I hate to be honest. Some dislikes like when I'm struggling to learn something but hey, it's part of the craft.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet but soon to be.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite stack would have to be Shopify stack or the MERN stack since shopify is the first thing after HTML and CSS that I'll be learning and then soon after the MERN stack to help me break into the blockchain industry.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

After learning the fundamentals and breaking into the industry with Shopify Development, I definitely have a passion for wanting to learn and master blockchain technologies and languages like Solidity. In the past before grasping the fundamentals of web development I tried to jump too far ahead and learn Solidity before the fundamentals of web development and got choked up and decided to go back and take things 1 step at a time before I get to where I want in my career in the future.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I see myself working creating DApps (Decentralized Apps) on the Lukso Blockchain for sure I know it, but also for other blockchains and being fully immersed in the web 3 world developing and also even designing since I'm into UI/UX and how things are changing in that space too.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would have told myself to slow down and not have shiny object syndrome jumping from guru to guru, from tech to tech and just focus on HTML and CSS along with learning UI design before jumping to JavaScript and other technologies. Then and only then to take my time learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and a basic framework like jQuery and a CMS like Shopify to help me break into the industry. Would have saved me months-year+ of my time honestly, but we're here and learned from mistakes.
