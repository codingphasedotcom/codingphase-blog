### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

Hey!! I'm Achay Biong. I'm 26 years old and I live and work in Roanoke, VA.

### How did you get interested in programming?

I became interested in programming while completing my bachelors degree. I was doing undergraduate research and I had to learn Python to complete the work. After awhile, I became interested in different programming languages and what I could do and create with them.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started around 2018, off and on. But I recently started taking it seriously.

### Where do you learn new skills?

I like to use different resources. I'm a visual learner, so I like video courses. I use YouTube, Udemy, CodingPhase, EdX, and Coursera.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love that no day is the same. I never get bored because there's always a challenge to overcome. I also love that there is more than one solution to problems.

### What do you hate about programming?

Nothing comes to mind.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, I'm still trying to honoe my skills before I start freelancing.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Anything I find interesting! Or become obsessed with for awhile before I move on.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to learn Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. I think it's so interesting and the applications for it are varied!!

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I will be working as a freelance developer while I work on completing my PhD in Materials Science.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself any advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Don't be so hard on yourself. Don't try to learn everything at once. Take your time and reach out to others in the tech community. Work on as many projects as possible to test and expand your skills. Remember to: HAVE FUN!!
