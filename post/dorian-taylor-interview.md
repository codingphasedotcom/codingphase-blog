### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

What's up everyone, I'm Dorian. I am located in Florida at the moment, but would love to leave the first opportunity I get. I was born in the north and I'm used to season, snow and the like. I just turned 30 years old and still feel the same. Nothing has changed but my age so far. Hopefully I can say the same 10 years later  

### How did you get interested in programming?

I was interested in doing IT and saw video of the guys from 37signals(now Basecamp). They used Ruby on Rails and made it seem simple. I nevered learn Ruby, but it piqued my interest.

### When did you start learning to code?

Officially December 2018, but I didn't fully commit to it until May 2019. CSS gave me a run for my money and I stopped for a period while learning a little graphic design and math.

### Where do you learn new skills?

All over there are too many to name, but I few I like are Udemy, Lynda and Youtube. Oh and Stackoverflow has dug me out of several ditches.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I really love the satisfaction I feel when I complete a task the teacher said and everything went wrong, but somehow I figure it out with the help of Google Search. It makes me feel like I can do this everytime.

### What do you hate about programming?

I hate that there are so many options. There are so many ways to do one that it paralyze me to take action sometimes. Thats why I just stick to what was suggested by the instructor until I run into a wall and have to figure it out.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

No I am not. I feel as though I am not ready. I only know HTML, CSS and very little Javascript. When I understand Javascript more I will start to apply for employment or freelance.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

Don't have one yet. Hopefully I like MERN, but as for application I favor 3: VS Code, Firefox Developer Edition and WSL(Ubuntu). The 3 of them together has given me the opportunity to code with ease so far.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I am a beginner in programming, but if I had to choose so far I would like to understand AI and VR. Those two together seems to be the future and I will love to be apart of that future. 

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Reaching my idea of what I believe to be success. A life with no debt, the ability to travel and a few investments to allow me stability in retirement is good enough for me. Yes, I'm a simple guy.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

Push and just get done. Don't procrastinate. It is only as hard as you believe it is. Everytime you run into a wall, look it up. The answer is out there.
